spirit_x3_tests
===============

This repository contains some tests and problems with Spirit X3 related to
the eddic project.

It contains some problems (problem_1 to problem_8) that are issues preventing
the grammar to work with eddic and some workaround (hacks) as well.

It contains some things that are "not nice", namely which could be made nicer
or more efficient. These are the not_nice_1 to not_nice_4 source files. It also
contains are grammar that is very slow to compile (monster).

All the files can be built with "make program", where program is the name of
the source you want to test.
